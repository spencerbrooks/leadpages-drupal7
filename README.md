Leadpages Drupal 7 Integration
==============================

A starting point feature and module for integrating Leadpages with Drupal 7, based off the approach outlined in [this article](http://s1l.org/leadpages-drupal-tutorial). It takes the article one step further by packaging it in an out-of-the-box solution you can install and use with minimal to no configuration.

This solution expands on the tutorial in a few ways:

1. Provides ready-made content types for landing pages and thank you pages, with preconfigured text formats and static page settings out of the box.
2. Includes custom code that automatically import the contents of an uploaded HTML file to the node body, so you can simply upload the exported HTML from Leadpages to your Drupal site, as opposed to copying the contents into the body field.

Requirements
------------

This solution depends on the following contributed modules:

* [Features](https://www.drupal.org/project/features)
* [Entity API](https://www.drupal.org/project/entity)
* [Strongarm](https://www.drupal.org/project/strongarm)
* [CTools](https://www.drupal.org/project/ctools)
* [Static page](https://www.drupal.org/project/static_page)
